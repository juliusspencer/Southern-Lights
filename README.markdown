Southern Lights
===============

Southern Lights is a project born out of a [coding session](http://www.meetup.com/Auckland-GTUG/events/41034342/) in November 2011 held at the [Auckland GTUG](http://www.gtugs.org/chapter.jsp?id=982001).

The idea is to control a set of lights through the Android ADK from a tablet and have music play along with it.

You can [see the project](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8WRH6P0_uY) in action on youtube.


Purpose
-------
The purpose of the project was to <b>learn</b> together and <b>have fun</b>.

The code was written as quickly as possible, doesn't use fragments, isn't the only way to do this and isn't designed for reusability.

We're making the code available so others can learn, hack it around or just use it as is. We'd enjoy seeing other people take this and make their own variations, improvements etc.


Third parties
------------
The following pieces of code were used / hacked into the project:

[DJDispatcher](https://bitbucket.org/damiankolakowski/djdispatcher/src)

Vertical SeekBar from an answer [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4892179/need-working-vertical-seekbar)

UsbAccessoryController from [The Android Open Source Project](http://source.android.com/source/index.html)

(I think that's it...)


Who
---
The idea for the project came from a conversation between David and Paul Hutchison.

The Android code was written by Julius Spencer.

The code for the ADK was written by Paul Hutchison.
