Southern Lights
===============

Southern Lights is a project born out of a [coding session](http://www.meetup.com/Auckland-GTUG/events/41034342/) in November 2011 held at the [Auckland GTUG](http://www.gtugs.org/chapter.jsp?id=982001).

The idea is to control a set of lights through the Android ADK from a tablet and have music play along with it.

You can [see the project](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8WRH6P0_uY) in action on youtube.


Who

The idea for the project came from a conversation between David and Paul Hutchison.

Thid parties

The following pieces of code were used / hacked into the project:
